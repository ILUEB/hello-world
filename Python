# print welcome message
print ("hello world") 

#all about strings
message = "hello world" # this is the variable
print (message) # this is whats getting printed
# for messages that contain quotes themselves
print ('She answered: Hi!"')
print (len(message)) # length=len

# the below is called slicing
print (message [10]) # the first character is a 0, in the above there are only 0-10 positions to indicate
print (message [0:5]) # this pulls the letter from 0 to 4, the first number is inclusive, the second is not!
print (message [:5]) # it also works if you leave out the 0
print (message [6:]) # this will get us the word world
