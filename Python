# print welcome message
print ("Hello World") 

#all about strings
message = "Hello World" # this is the variable
print (message) # this is whats getting printed
# for messages that contain quotes themselves
print ('She answered: Hi!"') # Or do a back slash before the real quotation mark \", this is called an "escape character"
print (len(message)) # length=len

# the below is called slicing
print (message [10]) # the first character is a 0, in the above there are only 0-10 positions to indicate
print (message [0:5]) # this pulls the letter from 0 to 4, the first number is inclusive, the second is not!
print (message [:5]) # it also works if you leave out the 0
print (message [6:]) # this will get us the word world

# a method is a function that belongs to an object

print (message.lower()) # this will get us the message in lower case
print (message.upper()) # this will get us the message in upper case

print (message.count("l")) # this will get us the number of ls in the message
print (message.find("World")) # this will get us the starting position of the word, in case the word does not exist it will print -1. 

# It is case sensitive!!!

message = message.replace("Hello", "Bye bye") # also works with new_message
print (message) # in that case here it must say print (new_message)

# combine strings to whole sentences, be carefull not to forget the space, use one of two options here
print ("Hello " + "World")
print ("Hello","World")

# combine strings to whole sentences, use variables
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Anika"
print (greeting + ", " + name)
# fomatted string
message = "{}, {}! Welcome to coding!".format (greeting, name)
print (message)

# alternative (with newer Python versions) f-Strings:
message = f"{greetings}, {name}! Welcome to coding!"
print (message)

# or even everything in upper case
message = f"{greetings.upper()}, {name.upper()}! Welcome to coding!"
print (message)

# a little trick to find methods available and information about them
print (dir(name))
print(help(str))
print(help(str.lower))

# if you want to make an interger to become a string (or the other way round) or even a float
print("hello "+str(5))
print(int("8")+5)
print(float("8.5")+5)
